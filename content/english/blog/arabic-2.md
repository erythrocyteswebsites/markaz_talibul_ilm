With the start of the new academic year approaching, make sure to register. May God bless you.

**Sheikh Mahmoud Shaker, may God have mercy on him, said:**

The Arabic language is the spirit and beating heart of the nation. If it weakens, the nation weakens, and if it strengthens, the nation strengthens. It is not just a language; it is the vessel that preserves religion, identity, and history.
