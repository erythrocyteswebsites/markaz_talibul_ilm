In Arabic grammar, "Mubtada" (المبتدأ) and "Khabar" (الخبر) are essential components of a nominal sentence (جملة اسمية). Unlike verbal sentences that start with a verb, nominal sentences begin with a noun or pronoun.

Mubtada (المبتدأ) – The subject of the sentence, usually a noun or pronoun, introduced at the beginning.
Example: الكتابُ (The book...)

Khabar (الخبر) – The predicate that provides information about the Mubtada, completing the meaning.
Example: مفيدٌ (...is beneficial)

Full Sentence: الكتابُ مفيدٌ ("The book is beneficial.")

Key Rules:\
✔ Both Mubtada and Khabar are marfoo’ (مرفوع) – they take dammah (ـُ) in default cases.\
✔ The Khabar can be a single word, phrase, or even a full sentence.\
✔ If the Mubtada is definite (like الكتابُ), the Khabar is usually indefinite (like مفيدٌ).

Learning Mubtada and Khabar helps in forming correct Arabic sentences, especially in classical texts and daily conversation.
